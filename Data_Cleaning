-- now when we are data cleaning we usually follow a few steps
-- 1. check for duplicates and remove any
-- 2. standardize data and fix errors
-- 3. Look at null values and see what 
-- 4. remove any columns and rows that are not necessary - few ways



-- 1. Remove Duplicates

# First let's check for duplicates



SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
;

SELECT company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
			PARTITION BY company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`) AS row_num
	FROM 
		world_layoffs.layoffs_staging;



SELECT *
FROM (
	SELECT company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
			PARTITION BY company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`
			) AS row_num
	FROM 
		world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
) duplicates
WHERE 
	row_num > 1;
    

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
WHERE company = 'Oda'
;

-- these are our real duplicates 
SELECT *
FROM (
	SELECT company, location, industry, total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,`date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
			PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,`date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions
			) AS row_num
	FROM 
		world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
) duplicates
WHERE 
	row_num > 1;







WITH DELETE_CTE AS (
	SELECT company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions, 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions) AS row_num
	FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
)
DELETE FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
WHERE (company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions, row_num) IN (
	SELECT company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions, row_num
	FROM DELETE_CTE
) AND row_num > 1;


ALTER TABLE world_layoffs.layoffs_staging ADD row_num INT;


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
;

CREATE TABLE `world_layoffs`.`layoffs_staging2` (
`company` text,
`location`text,
`industry`text,
`total_laid_off` INT,
`percentage_laid_off` text,
`date` text,
`stage`text,
`country` text,
`funds_raised_millions` int,
row_num INT
);

INSERT INTO `world_layoffs`.`layoffs_staging2`

			) AS row_num
	FROM 
		world_layoffs.layoffs_staging;

-- now that we have this we can delete rows were row_num is greater than 2

DELETE FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE row_num >= 2;







-- 2. Standardize Data

SELECT * 
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

-- if we look at industry it looks like we have some null and empty rows, let's take a look at these
SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE company LIKE 'Bally%';

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE company LIKE 'airbnb%';

-- it looks like airbnb is a travel, but this one just isn't populated.
-- write a query that if there is another row with the same company name, it will update it to the non-null industry values

UPDATE world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
SET industry = NULL
WHERE industry = '';


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

-- now we need to populate those nulls if possible

UPDATE layoffs_staging2 t1
JOIN layoffs_staging2 t2
ON t1.company = t2.company
SET t1.industry = t2.industry
WHERE t1.industry IS NULL
AND t2.industry IS NOT NULL;

-- and if we check it looks like Bally's was the only one without a populated row to populate this null values
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

-- ---------------------------------------------------

SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET industry = 'Crypto'
WHERE industry IN ('Crypto Currency', 'CryptoCurrency');


SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;



SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY country;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET country = TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM country);

-- now if we run this again it is fixed
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY country;



SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;


UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET `date` = STR_TO_DATE(`date`, '%m/%d/%Y');


ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
MODIFY COLUMN `date` DATE;


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;





-- 3. Look at Null Values






-- 4. remove any columns and rows we need to

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL;


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;


DELETE FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

SELECT * 
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
DROP COLUMN row_num;


SELECT * 
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;
